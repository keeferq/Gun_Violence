# Gun Violence Project 

## Chloropleth Map of Gun Violence per 100k people in the US from 2014-2023

##### This webmap gives the user the ability to interact with state and county level data of gun violence incidents. It is meant to make this data easy to parse through.

##### The design is meant to be simple and clean and just allow interaction with the data. 

##### The data is from the Gun violence archive, and was aggregated to state and county level. The incidents per 100k were created with the formula (Incident Count / Total Population) * 100,000 the population data was from the US Census.
